# Recent Activities Fix Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
The recent activities section on the progress dashboard was broken, but the one on the dashboard overview page worked well.

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. **Replaced Broken Recent Activities**
- **Removed**: The broken recent activities section that was trying to use `progressData?.recentActivities`
- **Added**: The working `RecentActivitiesWidget` component from the dashboard overview page
- **Result**: Now uses the same reliable data source and display logic

### 2. **Component Integration**
- **Imported**: `RecentActivitiesWidget` into `ProgressDashboardScreen.tsx`
- **Replaced**: The entire broken activities section with `<RecentActivitiesWidget />`
- **Cleaned**: Removed all unused styles related to the old activities section

### 3. **Data Source**
The working `RecentActivitiesWidget` uses:
- **Lesson Progress**: Queries `lesson_progress` table for completed lessons
- **Daily Goals**: Integrates flashcard and game activities from daily goals
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes when component comes into focus
- **Proper Filtering**: Only shows completed lessons with timestamps

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```tsx
{progressData?.recentActivities.map((activity, index) => (
  <View key={index} style={styles.activityCard}>
    // Broken data structure and display
  </View>
))}
```

### After (Working)
```tsx
<RecentActivitiesWidget />
```

### Features of the Working Component
- **Real-time Data**: Queries actual database tables
- **Multiple Sources**: Lessons, flashcards, games
- **Smart Filtering**: Only completed activities with timestamps
- **Refresh Capability**: Manual refresh button
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and loading states
- **Consistent UI**: Matches the dashboard overview design

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Results

- **Recent activities** now display properly on the progress dashboard
- **Same functionality** as the dashboard overview page
- **Real-time updates** when activities are completed
- **Consistent user experience** across both screens
- **No more broken data** or empty activity lists

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources Used

1. **Lesson Progress**: `lesson_progress` table with completed lessons
2. **Daily Goals**: Flashcard and game progress from daily goals
3. **User Activities**: Real user interaction data
4. **Timestamps**: Proper time formatting and sorting

The recent activities section on the progress dashboard should now work exactly like the one on the dashboard overview page!
